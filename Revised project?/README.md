# Revised Project: Predicting Stroke victims

In this element, I will be recreating my Titanic survivors project, this time working with a stroke patient dataset. I will be buulding two models (decision tree and one other model) and comparing which one has better accuracy by computing the cross validated error for each one, then deploying the best one on the validation set. 

This element will include a step by step notebook that explains the code in lay terms.

Maybe also try to find groups that are at high risk? Then compare it to current medical statistics for who is at risk of stroke.
