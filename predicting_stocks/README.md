# Predicting Stock Prices

After a semester of machine learning, I had a lot of tools under my belt. Not only did I learn about many algorithms, but I also learned how to assess them. In this element, I will be applying my skills to an area I am interested in: finance. 

In this step by step jupyter notebook, I will be predicting the closing prices of stocks a certain number of days in the future. For this element, I will also be relying on sklearn, although I could have used deep learning due to the sequential nature of stocks prices depending on what happened to the stock the day before. 

After completing this element, it made me reflect on the task I had chosen for myself. Instead of trying to predict the price of a stock in the future, I should have mastered a simpler task first, predicting the direction in which a stock's price will move. After all, in the industry, the most important question is which direction the stock price moves, only then is it a question of magnitude of the direction. 

I included the code as a large function in predicting_stocks.py. To accompany this, I wrote unit tests.
