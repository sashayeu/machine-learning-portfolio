# Sasha Yeutseyeva's Machine Learning Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my machine learning portfolio. 

My name is Sasha Yeutseyeva, I am a sophomore at Smith College double majoring in Computer Science and Statistical and Data Sciences from Burlington, Canada. My past experiences include being a research assistant, participating in Goldman Sachs and D.E. Shaw's fellowships, and completing a project with Harvard College's Data Analytics Group. Outside of academics, I spent a large portion of my life as a competitive swimmer, and this year I am a student academic advisor. Over the course of my time as a CS student, I've acquired general skills such as GitHub, Python, Java, R, etc. 

Here is a link to my resume to get to know more about me: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-m588DJ5LfT_aEGNBZ4qVQTxbTi1UNHWCamCq3-RmDk/edit?usp=sharing

During the Spring 2021 semester, I had the pleasure of taking a computational machine learning class at Smith. Going into the class without knowing what Machine Learning even is, I would say I learned and grew a lot as a computer scientist. Here are just some of the skills I picked up this semester:
- Classification: Identifying to which predetermined category an observation belongs 
- Clustering: Finding similar groups of observations 
- Benchmarking: Evaluating algorithms based on time and epochs 
- Training/Testing: Diving data in different ways to train and then test the algorithm

This was a very hands on class, so I would say my underdstanding of the logic of all the algorithms goes beyond just how to use the ones included in the sklearn package. I applied these algorithms, and even wrote my own, in weekly homework assignments and two projects. 

Outside of this class, my interests beyond machine learning include:
- Software engineering: Software is everywhere in this world. I enjoy the problem solving process of engineering and hope to contribute to this field in my future. 
- Finance: I've attended programs of a handful of finance firms, captivated by the wide array of statistical and software applications. This got me interested in increasing equity throughout the industry.
- Poker: In May 2020, I began learning poker with Smith's poker club. In September 2020, I took over as the club's president and organize lessons for new members.

This portfolio highlights just some of the things I learned in this class. The three directories are:

- Unsupervised learning: In this directory, I explore the cold implementation of K-means.
- Supervised learning: Here, I build two different supervised learning models and choose the better one.
- Independent element: With all the skills I learned in class, I attempt to apply my knowledge to finance and predict the price of tesla stock.

Feel free to begin with any directory, although my recommended order is unsupervised, then supervised, then predicting_stocks!
