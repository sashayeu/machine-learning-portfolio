# Cold Kmeans 

In this jupyter notebook, I explore how countries of the world can be grouped based on exports, income, and GDP per capita. By using my own implementation of kmeans, I find the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and examine the resulting groups. 

This element includes a discussion about the efficacy of the functions in time, as well as a comparison between my cold implementation of kmeans and the one available in the sklearn package.
