# Cold Kmeans 

In this jupyter notebook, I explore how countries of the world can be grouped based on imports, exports, income, and GDP per capita. By using my own implementation of kmeans, I find the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and examine the resulting groups. In the end, to compare my implementation of kmeans to that of sklearn, I examine the amount of time each takes.
